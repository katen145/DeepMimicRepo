# DeepMimicRepo
Repository for modified DeepMimic code with code to create reference motions, create rollouts, analyze generated motion with plots

HDF5ToMimic.zip code for conversion of HDF5 files to DeepMimic format, also code for analysis of generated trajectories.
The DeepMimic section has modified DeepMimic code and added character file and argument file.
The mp4 videos in the repository are simulated motions from the trained policies


To get a roll-out execute the policy and press 'y' in the simulation to save data to output.txt
